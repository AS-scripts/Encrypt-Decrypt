## Story
**Caesar Cipher:** Julius Caesar needed a simple way to send secret messages to his army. He created the Caesar Cipher, shifting letters by a fixed number to scramble his messages. Though basic by today’s standards, it’s a classic introduction to cryptography.  
**About This Project:** This modified Caesar Cipher supports encryption and decryption of uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numbers, and a wide range of symbols. Unlike the traditional cipher, it uses a custom shuffled character set, significantly increasing the complexity and making the encoded messages much harder to interpret or crack. This approach enhances security while maintaining the simplicity of the classic Caesar Cipher technique.
